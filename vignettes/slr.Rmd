# Introduction

This vignette demonstrates the use of the `slr` function from the `mySLRPackage` to perform simple linear regression on the `mtcars` dataset, focusing on the relationship between a car's weight (`wt`) and its fuel efficiency (`mpg`).

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
library(mySLRPackage)
library(car)
```

To use the function `slr`:

```{r}
slr(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
```

To include plot:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, main = "Fuel Efficiency vs. Car Weight",
     xlab = "Car Weight", ylab = "Fuel Efficiency (mpg)",
     pch = 19, col = "blue")  # using blue points for better visibility
abline(results$intercept, results$slope, col = "red") 
```
